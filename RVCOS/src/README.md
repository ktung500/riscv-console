# Project 3
## Nicholas McLean 915804621 & Kevin Tung 915936476
### Sources
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/queue_program_in_c.htm
Based our queue's off this implementation. 

### Working
Has Makefile and submission compiles 
Has README with sources cited 
Can correctly run updated apps from project 2 
All allocations using RVCMemoryAllocate (even if malloc is used to implement 
RVCMemoryAllocate) 
TCBs are dynamically allocated (no 256 limit of fixed array) 
RVCWriteText supports VT100 codes 
RVCWriteText blocks until next video refresh 
Mutexes are fully functional 

### Not Working
MemoryPools  are  implemented  correctly  (exception  may  be  system  pool  using 
malloc/free still) 
System memory pool does not rely on malloc/free at all 
Full applications execute correctly
